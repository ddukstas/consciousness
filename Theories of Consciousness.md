<h1 id="theories-of-consciousness">Theories of Consciousness</h1>
<p><strong>Philosophy of mind</strong> is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of the mind.<br>
It addresses <strong>the hard problem of consciousness</strong> which explains how and why we have <strong>qualia</strong>.<br>
<strong>Qualia</strong> is an individual instances of subjective, conscious experience.</p>
<h2 id="monism">Monism</h2>
<p><strong>No fundamental division</strong>. In Western philosophy most common form of monism is <strong>physicalism</strong> which states that everything is physical. In opposition to that there’s <strong>non-physicalism</strong> theories which state that either no physical reality exist or physical and non-physical is two ways describing the same phenomena.</p>
<h3 id="physicalism">Physicalism</h3>
<p>The only existing substance is physical, in some sense of that term to be clarified by our best science.</p>
<p><strong>Behaviorism:</strong> introspective reports on one’s own <strong>interior mental life are not subject to careful examination for accuracy</strong>. Without generalizability and the possibility of third-person examination psychology cannot be scientific.</p>
<p><strong>Identity theory:</strong> mental states are probably identical to internal states of the brain. E.g. the mental state “<strong>desire for a cup of coffee</strong>” would thus <strong>correspond to</strong> the “<strong>firing of certain neurons</strong> in certain brain regions”</p>
<p><strong>Functionalism:</strong> mental states are characterized by their <strong>causal relations</strong> with <strong>other mental states</strong> and with <strong>sensory inputs</strong> and <strong>behavioral outputs</strong>. Empirical computational theory of the mind is an example of functionalism.</p>
<p><strong>Non-reductive physicalism:</strong> mental states cannot be reduced to behavior, brain states or functional states. Mental states are causally reducible, but ontologically irreducible to physical states.</p>
<p><strong>Weak emergentism:</strong> nature consists of layers arranged in terms of increasing complexity and each corresponding to its own special science.</p>
<h3 id="non-physicalism">Non-physicalism</h3>
<p><strong>Idealism:</strong> the only existing substance is mental.</p>
<p><strong>Neutral monism:</strong> there is a more basic level of reality, where <strong>mental</strong> and <strong>the physical</strong> are two ways of organizing or describing <strong>the same elements</strong> which themselves are neither physical nor mental.</p>
<h2 id="dualism">Dualism</h2>
<p>Mental phenomena are, in some respects, non-physical.</p>
<h3 id="substance-dualism">Substance dualism</h3>
<p>There are <strong>physical</strong> and <strong>non-physical</strong> substances. Consciousness is an independently existing non-physical substance.</p>
<h3 id="property-dualism">Property dualism</h3>
<p>Physical and non-physical properties <strong>emerge from the same thing</strong> and cannot be reduced further.<br>
e.g. Neural activity has <strong>EM potential</strong> (physical prop.) and <strong>consciousness</strong> (non-physical prop.).</p>
<p><strong>Strong emergentism</strong>: when matter is organized in the appropriate way, mental properties emerge in a way not fully accountable for by physical laws.</p>
<p><strong>Epiphenomenalism:</strong> mental phenomena are <strong>causally ineffectual</strong>. Physical events can cause other physical events and physical events can cause mental events, but mental events cannot cause anything.</p>
<p><strong>Non-reductive physicalism:</strong> mental properties form a separate ontological class to physical properties. E.g. consciousness is a non-physical property like electric charge is a physical property.</p>
<p><strong>Panpsychism:</strong> all matter has certain element of consciousness. Universe has consciousness at its base. This creates boundaries problem: e.g. to be me or to be someone else.</p>

<h3 id="strange-loop">Strange loop</h3>
<p><strong>Douglas Hofstadter</strong> - professor of cognitive science whose research focuses on the sense of self in relation to the external world.<br>
He made an attempt to use concept of <strong>strange loop</strong> to explain the sense of “<em><strong>I</strong></em>”.<br>

<h3 id="microtubules">Microtubules</h3>
<p><strong>Stuart Hameroff</strong> - anesthesiologist and professor. Claims that quantum states in neural microtubules are responsible for its emergence. <strong>objective reduction (OR)</strong> could link the brain to the fundamental spacetime geometry.<br>
<strong>Orchestrated objective reduction (Orch-OR)</strong> is a hypothesis that consciousness in the brain originates from processes inside neurons, rather than from connections between neurons (the conventional view).<br>
